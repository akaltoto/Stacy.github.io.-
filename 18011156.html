        <p>
            A screenshot, also called <span>screen capture</span> or <span>screen grab</span>, is a digital image of what should be visible on a monitor, television, or other visual output device.<br />
 A common screenshot is created by the operating system or software running on the device. A screenshot or screen capture may also be created by taking a photo of the screen.<br /><Br />

            <em>TO PRESERVE SCREENCASTS.</em>
            The first screenshots were created with the first interactive computers around 1960. Through the 1980s, computer operating systems did not universally have built-in functionality for capturing screenshots. Sometimes text-only screens could be dumped to a text file, but the result would only capture the content of the screen, not the appearance, nor were graphics screens preservable this way. Some systems had a BSAVE command that could be used to capture the area of memory where screen data was stored, but this required access to a BASIC prompt. Systems with composite video output could be connected to a VCR, and entire screencasts preserved this way.

        <h2><a name="C2"> Build-in screenshot functions</a></h2>
        
        <h3><a name="C3">Windows</a></h3>
        <p>
            On Windows, <strong>pressing <EM>PrtScr</EM> captures a screenshot of the entire desktop,</strong> while <EM>Alt</EM>+<EM>PrtScr</EM> captures only the active window. Captured screenshots do not include the mouse pointer. Windows places these captured screenshots in the clipboard, meaning that an additional program needs to retrieve them from the clipboard. Starting with Windows 8.0, however,<EM> Win</EM>+<EM>PrtScr</EM> or <EM>Win</EM>+<EM>Volume up</EM> instantly saves a screenshot to the "Screenshots" folder in "Pictures" library. All screenshots are saved as PNG files. <highlight>Note: On some notebooks you have to hold Fn and then press PrtScr instead.</highlight></p> 

        <p><strong>Windows Vista and later include a utility called <highlight>Snipping Tool</highlight>.</strong><br /><br /><img src="images/windows2.jpg" align ="left" width="500" height="300"> &emsp;    &emsp;&emsp;  &emsp;&emsp;<img src="images/windows3.jpg"width="500" height="300" /><br />First introduced in Windows XP Tablet PC Edition. It is a screen-capture tool that allows taking screenshots ("snips") of a window, rectangular area, or free-form area. Starting with Windows 10, Snipping Tool gained time delay functionality, useful for capturing context menus. Snips can then be annotated, saved as an image file or as an HTML page, or emailed. However, it does not work with non-tablet XP versions but represents an XP compatible equivalent. Windows 7 and later also include Problem Step Recorder as part of their troubleshooting platforms that once started, automatically captures a screenshot at mouse clicks.</p>

<p>There are exceptions to what can be captured by this method. For example, contents in hardware overlay are not captured. This includes video images that Windows Media Player 10 or earlier play. As such, special software may be required to capture the screens of video games.
        </p>
        

        <h3><a name="C4">Apple MacOs</a></h3>
        <p>
            On macOS, <strong>a user can take a screenshot of an entire screen by pressing <em>⌘ Cmd</em>+<em>⇧ Shift</em>+<em>3</em>, or of a chosen area of the screen by <em>⌘ Cmd</em>+<em>⇧ Shift</em>+<em>4</em>.</strong> This screenshot is saved to the user's desktop, with one PNG file per attached monitor. If the user holds down <em>Ctrl</em> while doing either then the screenshot will be copied to the clipboard instead.</p><img src="images/mac1.jpeg" />

        <P>Beginning with Mac OS X Panther, it is possible to make a screenshot of an active application window. By following <em>⌘ Cmd</em>+<em>⇧ Shift</em>+<em>4</em>, with pressing the Spacebar, the cross-hair cursor turns into a small camera icon. The current window under the cursor is highlighted, and a click on the mouse or trackpad will capture a screenshot of the entire highlighted element (including the parts offscreen or covered by other windows).</P>

        <p>A provided application called <HIGHLIGHT>Grab</HIGHLIGHT> will capture a chosen area, a whole window, the whole screen, or the whole screen after 10 seconds and pops the screenshot up in a window ready for copying to the clipboard or saving as a TIFF. The Preview application, also provided, has the same capture options as Grab but opens the captured image immediately in a new window.

    A shell utility called <highlight>"screencapture"</highlight> (located in /usr/sbin/screencapture) can be used from the Terminal application or in shell scripts to capture screenshots and save them to files. Various options are available to choose the file format of the screenshot, how the screenshot is captured, if sounds are played, etc. This utility might only be available when the Mac OS X developer tools are installed. A user cannot capture the screen while DVD Player is running.

                <h3><a name="C5">Apple iOS</a></h3>

        <p>
            A screenshot can be taken on iOS by simultaneously pressing the <EM>Home button</EM> and the <EM>Lock button</EM>, however on the new iPhone X it is achieved by pressing the <EM>Volume up</EM> and <EM>Lock button</EM>. The screen will flash and the picture will be stored in PNG format in the "Camera Roll" if the device has a camera, or in "Saved Photos" if the device does not. From the iOS 11 update a little preview will pop up in the bottom left corner, which can be swiped left to save or clicked to open up an editor where the screenshot can be cropped or doodled on before being saved or shared. The screenshot feature is available with iOS 2.0 and later.[9] The same ⌘ Cmd+⇧ Shift+3 shortcut for Mac OS is used in iOS to take a screenshot, with ⌘ Cmd+⇧ Shift+4 bringing the screenshot directly in iOS' editing window in iOS 11 and later. Third-party Bluetooth keyboards often have a key or function key command devoted to taking a screenshot.


                <h3><a name="C6">Chrom OS</a></h3>
        <p>
            On Chromebook and related devices with the Chrome OS keyboard layout, pressing the equivalent of ，<em>Ctrl</em>+<em>F5</em> on a standard keyboard will capture the entire screen, and the equivalent of <em>Ctrl</em>+<em>⇧ Shift</em>+<em>F5</em> will turn the mouse into a rectangle select tool for capturing a custom portion of the screen.[citation needed]
